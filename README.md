# <center><font face="Times New Roman" color=black size=7>Introduction to the Memorability Experiment of PGPP</font></center>
## <font face="Times New Roman" color=black size=6>Section 1. A brief introduction to PGPP</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">Passwords are easy to understand, convenient to use and less expensive to deploy, thus they will still be the most important authentication method in the foreseeable future. So it is necessary to improve the robustness of passwords to make them secure and memorable. Based on this, we propose a new **password generation mechanism  based on personal preference(PGPP), which can generate passwords with **sufﬁcient security and acceptable memorability**. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman"> To improve password memorability, we make the generated passwords satisfy the **Interleaved Security Chunk (ISC)** of user-constructed passwords, but have significantly more interleaved layers and high-security parts generated by Long Short-Term Memory. ISC means that, a high-security chunk and a low-security chunk are arranged alternately, and the adjacent former and latter form an interleaved layer.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman"> To resist targeted attacks, inspired by human memory laws, we design a **Q\&A mechanism** to collect users' insensitive information. Such information forms low-security parts after some operations, including keyword extraction, synonym association and Markov segmentation. It is worth noting that our Q\&A design can **guarantee the probability regression of the question selection and the uniform distribution of the answer space**. This overcomes the shortcomings of existing PGMs based on the Q\&A mechanism (e.g., Cognitive passwords and Associative passwords).</font>


<font face="Times New Roman">Most previous PGMs were only available in a single-language, mainly English. As of September 2020, Chinese netizens accounted for 20\% of the world's Internet netizens. Thus, we give constructions of PGPP in both Chinese and English, and release the corresponding materials. PGPP is customizable and can be extended to different languages and application scenarios. We also analyze the memorability and security of the generated passwords from both theoretical estimation and experimental testing, and compare PGPP with leading PGMs, such as Surpass, Optiwords and MneGenEx/MnePerEx.</font>


## <font face="Times New Roman" color=black size=6>Section 2. Design of the memorability experiment of PGPP</font>
#### <font face="Times New Roman">The memorability experiment includes the following two phases:</font> 

#### <font face="Times New Roman">●  Phase 1.</font>
<font face="Times New Roman">

***- Collection of demographic information.*** The webpage displays ''Imagine you are registering an e-commerce account, please follow the system prompts and remember the generated password''. A participant shall fill in her email, gender, age, highest degree and occupation (whether she is an information security practitioner).

***- Password generation.*** A participant selects the desired password length (8~20) and questions, and answers the questions. Next, PGPP generates a password and displays it with the understandable password annotation on the webpage. 

***- Memory training.*** A participant is required to enter the password correctly 3 times to end memory training. When the participant forgets the password, she can click the button on the webpage to view the password, and then she is required to re-enter the password correctly 3 times.

***- Memory interference.*** A participant is asked to watch a 3-minute video.

***- Short-term recall.*** A participant is asked to enter the password correctly within 5 attempts. Otherwise, she is believed to forget the password.

***- Questionnaire 1.*** The questionnaire asks the participant whether she records the password. If she does not forget the password in Short-term recall of Phase 1, after 48 hours, she will be invited to participate in Phase 2. In particular, for an English participant, we will assign a corresponding survey code, which is her voucher for getting rewards for Phase 1 on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and participating in Phase 2 of the memorability experiment.</font>





#### <font face="Times New Roman">●  Phase 2.</font>
<font face="Times New Roman">

***- Verification of demographic information.*** A participant shall fill in the same personal information as in Phase 1 before passing the identity authentication of Phase 2. An English participant shall fill in an additional survey code. 

***- Long-term recall.*** Similar to Short-term recall of Phase 1, a participant is asked to enter the password correctly within 5 attempts. Otherwise, she is believed to forget the password. 

***- Questionnaire 2.*** The questionnaire asks the participant whether she records the password. Specially, for an English participant, we will assign her a new survey code, which is the voucher for her to receive the remuneration of Phase 2.

## <font face="Times New Roman" color=black size=6>Section 3.  Demonstration videos of the memorability experiment of JoyMem</font>

Due to high maintenance costs, we closed the experimental platform after completing the memorability experiment. However, to give readers an intuitive impression, we provide several **demonstration videos** of the memorability experiment of JoyMem in Chinese and English scenarios. We choose 8 and 12 as the representative password lengths, corresponding to 2 and 3 questions that need to be answered respectively. 

####  The video list is as follows:

a)	Chinese scene: password length = 8, and a user can remember the password effortlessly

[Phase 2: https://youtu.be/ofCIvZ-pwhs](https://youtu.be/ofCIvZ-pwhs)

b)	Chinese scene: password length = 12, and a user can remember the password through memory training

## <font face="Times New Roman" color=black size=6>Section 4.  Results of the memorability experiment of JoyMem</font>

To evaluate the memorability of the passwords generated by JoyMem, we invite 394 participants online, including 252 Chinese-speaking participants and 142 English-speaking participants. For Chinese participants, we send emails containing the purpose, process and links of the experiment to invite native Chinese speakers. For English participants, we recruit native English speakers through Mturk crowdsourcing service. For the demographic information of these participants, see **Section 5** .

The memorability experimental results of JoyMem and the leading PGMs are shown in Table I. The results show that, the passwords generated by JoyMem have acceptable memorability. The user does not have to spend too much time and effort to create the password, and can easily remember it.

## <font face="Times New Roman" color=black size=6>Section 5.  Demographic information of participants</font>
Combined with the memorability experiment results in Table I, we analyze in more detail the habit of setting passwords and the ability to remember passwords of different user groups.

For Chinese and English participants, the ratios of male to female are both close to 1:1, which conform to the real-world situation. Participants aged 18\~34 account for a large proportion (Chinese: 88.49\%, English: 77.46\%). They are more familiar with the Internet and passwords, and have a more positive attitude towards questions. These participants have significantly higher success rates for Short-term and Long-term recall. Among them, the success rate of Short-term recall of Chinese participants is 98.40\% (185/188), which is higher than that of all other age groups; and the success rate of Long-term recall is 68.26\% (114/167), only lower than that of participates aged 18 (71.43\%, 5/7). The success rates of Short-term and Long-term recall of English participants are 98.00\% (49/50) and 74.42\% (32/43) respectively, the highest among all age groups. This may be caused by the good memory and high motivation of the participants aged 18\~24.
    
When grouping participants according to the highest degree, we find that participants with higher degrees tend to set longer passwords, reflecting their stronger security awareness. The average password lengths for Chinese and English participants with High school degree, Bachelor degree, Master degree and Doctor degree are: Unknown and 10.83; 11.24 and 12.48; 12.28 and 12.04; 12.54 and 12.53. ''Unknown" means that there are no Chinese participants with High school degree in our experiment, so we cannot calculate the average password length. The results show that, irrespective of other demographic characteristics, people with higher degrees often realize that increasing password length can improve the security.

**Information security practitioners** (denoted as ISPs) generally have a stronger sense of security due to their expertise. Chinese and English ISPs account for a large proportion of Chinese and English participants: 30.56\% (77/252) and 55.63\% (79/142). The average password lengths for ISPs and non-ISPs are: 11.89 and 11.62 (Chinese); 12.02 and 11.68 (English). It can be seen that the average password length for ISPs is slightly larger than that of non-ISPs. In addition, ISPs have higher recall success rates, especially for Long-term recall. Taking ISPs and non-ISPs with similar numbers among English participants as examples, the success rates are: 98.73\% (78/79) and 94.92\% (56/59) for Short-term recall; 77.14\% (54/70) and 59.26\% (32/54) for Long-term recall.
